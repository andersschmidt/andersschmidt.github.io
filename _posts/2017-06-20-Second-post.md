For a while I have been interested in sharing some of the basic functionalities when using R for data science with my fellow research colleges. I decided to go for it, at prepare a basic workshop in R. The course was prepared in collaboration with my fellow college, PhD-candidate [Emil Tveden Bjerglund](https://github.com/emiltb).

The workshop outline covered:

1. ”The R-Safari”.
2. Simple mutations of a dataset using **Dplyr**
3. ”Show me data” – plotting with **ggplot**
4. Load and ”wrangle” of datasets

To activate the students Emil build a small learning environment, which was loaded through the learnr package: [rbeginner](https://github.com/emiltb/rbeginner). Although some students struggled installing R and loading the dependencies the overall experience was, that this approach is useful for R-fisttimers.
